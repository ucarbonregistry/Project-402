36 MW Biomass Based Grid Supply Power Project by SDSSSKL, Shirol, India

The project 36 MW Biomass Based Grid Supply Power Project by SDSSSKL, Shirol,
India is located in Datta Nagar, Village: Shirol, Tehsil: Shirol, District: Kolhapur, State:
Maharashtra, Country: India.

The project activity is a 36 MW renewable biomass (bagasse) based electricity generation
cogeneration facility by the project proponent (PP) M/s. Shree Datta Shetkari Sahakari Sakhar
Karkhana Ltd (SDSSSKL). The purpose of the project activity is to generate fossil free electricity
using renewable biomass and thereby reduce GHG emissions by displacing fossil fuel dominated grid
based electricity with such biomass based renewable electricity.

The commissioning date of this UCR project activity is the date of first commercial supply of power
to the grid which was established on 11/08/2011 (as per the PPA dated 21/06/2013). Grid
connectivity was however, established on 04/08/2011.

In a typical sugarcane crushing season, the gross power generation capacity is 33.50 MW, and in the
off-season, it is 36 MW. Captive consumption is typically 11 MW and 3.5 MW during the on- and
off-season respectively while approximately 22.50 MW and 32.50 MW are exported to the state grid,
i.e. Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Limited (MSEDL).

The power co-generation units generate biomass based power for captive consumption of the sugar
plant and the sale of surplus power to the state grid. The primary goal of the project activity is to
generate electricity using renewable biomass and thereby reduce emissions by displacing fossil fuel
dominated grid-based electricity generation with renewable energy-based electricity generation.
Power is generated and supplied in the sugar season and off-season at 11 kV and stepped-up on-site to
132 kV before being transmitted to the nearby Jaysingpur sub-station located at Kolhapur
During the absence of biomass, coal is used to generate electricity. 

The use of fossil fuel is limited to the extent of 15% of total fuel consumption as per the regulation of the Ministry of New and Renewable
Energy. The amount of fossil fuels co-fired does not exceed 80% of the total fuel fired on an energy
basis according to ACM0006- CDM methodology booklet of UNFCCC. Hence the project is eligible
for UCR CoUs.
